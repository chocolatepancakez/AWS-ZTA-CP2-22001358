# Architecture Overview

This folder contains the proposed Zero Trust Architecture reference model for the implemented AWS environment.

The diagram provides a high-level view of the system, including:
- Private VPC and subnet design
- EC2 instances and security boundaries
- IAM role-based access control
- AWS Systems Manager as the sole access mechanism
- VPC endpoints used for private connectivity
- Centralized logging using AWS CloudTrail

The architecture diagram serves as a visual reference to support the detailed configurations documented in the repository and the final report.
