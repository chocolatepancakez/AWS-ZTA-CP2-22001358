# Validation Overview

This folder documents the empirical validation conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Zero Trust Architecture implemented in AWS.

Validation is structured according to the four evaluation metrics defined in Chapter 3 of the final report:
1. Authorized Session Success Rate
2. Unauthorized Identity Access Denial Rate
3. MFA Condition Enforcement Rate
4. Internet Egress Block Rate

Each metric is validated through controlled test cases performed in the implemented AWS environment.
