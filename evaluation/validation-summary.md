# Validation Summary

The validation results confirm that the implemented AWS Zero Trust Architecture satisfies all four evaluation metrics defined in the project methodology.

Authorized access was reliably granted through SSM, unauthorized identities were consistently denied, MFA enforcement was strictly applied, and all outbound internet connectivity was successfully blocked.

These results demonstrate effective practical enforcement of Zero Trust principles in the implemented AWS environment.
